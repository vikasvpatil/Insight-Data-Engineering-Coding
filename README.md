Idea is to develop a Python code which will do the word count and calculate running median.

Steps to execute the program :-

1) Run the bash file - run.sh
2) This will execute the Python script wordcount_median.py
3) This will take the combined text files as input from wc_input directory
4) It will find median and word count and store in wc_output directory as med_result.txt and wc_result.txt
