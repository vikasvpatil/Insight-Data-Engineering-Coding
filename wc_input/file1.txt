On the south side of Highway sixteen and Pewaukee Road, a digital billboard stands near the office of its owner, Clear Channel Communications. Every eight seconds, a new ad flashes on the board.

The billboard here is one of ten digital billboards owned by Clear Channel in Southeastern Wisconsin, according to Joe Stribl, digital media manager. It's ten feet tall by fifty feet wide, and contains close to four million light emitting diodes (LEDs), which display a rotation of up to eight ads each day.

The billboard was installed in November this year
